# Total Commander enhanced #

* Author: Ralf Kefferpuetz

- added support for   64bit version of Total Commander
- speaks left/ right for the 2 file windows when moving between them, now also for FTP connections
- added a file index to be spoken in the listView
- added speaking of top and bottom for beginning and end of the listview
- added hotkey Alt-1 to get the current file window announced together with the activated Tab name. If no Tabs are used it announces the current directory instead
- speaks active Tab when control-tab and control-shift-tab is used
